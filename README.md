### What is an MQP?
The Major Qualifying Project (MQP) is completed by every undergraduate student at WPI, similar to a senior capstone. MQPs are high-level research projects that address problems typical of those found in the student's professional discipline, and as such as coordinated through students' academic departments. <br/>
Generally completed by teams, this MQP was done independently as a continuation of research being done through the past few summers at my internship. 

## Abstract
Today, an estimated 38,000 new HIV infections still occur in the United States (CDC, 2020). During the early signs of immune recognition by T cells, virus-derived peptides are presented by MHC molecules on the cellular surface. In HIV infection, immune responses and immune protection are not very well defined. In this project, we analyze HIV-specific patterns during antigen processing and presentation and develop computational tools to aid in the process of the analyses. From this area of study, further advancement in protein degradation analyses and in immunopeptidome definition may help in identifying targets for efficient immune clearance and a future vaccine design.

## GitHub Organization
Within the MQP20, there are example .txt files that are used within Python code distributed amongst the various folders. <br/>
There are also files for the MQP paper and PowerPoint presentation.

#### BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool was used for peptide data.

#### Misc Code: Code created for various specific tasks within the lab. 

#### MySQL Databases: Code and protocols for database design for wet lab data.

#### Other Protocols: Protocols for code stored in various other folders. 

#### Presentations: Group meeting presentations.

#### Pymol: Molecular visualization system for proteins.
